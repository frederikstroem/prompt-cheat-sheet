# [Prompt cheat sheet for OpenAi's ChatGPT 4](#prompt)
## [psource](https://github.com/frederikstroem/prompt-cheat-sheet/blob/main/psource.py)
Prints the source code of files recursively in the current directory, easy for ChatGPT to digest.

### Usage
**Copy source code recursively of current directory to clipboard:**
```bash
psource | xsel -b
```
*Output can be piped to clipboard using [xsel](https://github.com/kfish/xsel) or similar tools.*

**Copy source code of two files and one directory to clipboard:**
```bash
psource file1 file2 dir1 | xsel -b
```

### Install `psource` command:
```bash
wget -O ~/.local/bin/psource https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frederikstroem/prompt-cheat-sheet/main/psource.py && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/psource
```
**Note:** psource is still very early in the development process, migration to Rust is considered.

## Prompt
### Change code

FIRST PROMPT INPUT

First input is a description of what code changes to make, this can include refactoring, adding new code, removing code, etc. Separate different points can be added, by adding blank lines between them.
Second input comes when paths are encourted with source code following. Each source code list item first line is `$ /a/path/to/a/file` $.

FIRST PROMPT OUTPUT

First output is very short description of what code changes were made.
Second output is all changes made. Each file is separated by a blank line. Each file starts with a very short description of this change, followed by a new line with path `**/path/to/a/file**`, followed by a code block (```) of the file after changes are applied. Output only the lines affected by change, as to keep your output short. If multiple changes are made in the same file they put inside separate code blocks.

NTH PROMPT INPUT

First input is comments on the changes made.

NTH PROMPT OUTPUT

Be helpful and try to use feedback from the user to improve the code changes or what is otherwise asked of you.
